  * Added missing empty line the in d/control generated by jh_makepkg
  * Bumped debhelper compat to 8 in packages generated by jh_makepkg
  * Fixed the "find" expressions in jh_repack to only remove files
    named "*.jar" or "*.class".  Thanks to Andrew Ross for the report.
    (Closes: #646514)
  * Fixed a bug where jh_build would generate manifests with lines
    longer than some jar implementations would allow.  Thanks to
    Giovanni Mascellani for the report.  (Closes: #653412)
  * Fixed a bug where java-propose-classpath would "hide" javax imports.
    Thanks to Jan Janak for the report and the correction.
    (Closes: #653731)
  * Bumped dependency on libarchive-zip-perl due to some issues with
    the previous version that caused corrupt jar files.  For more
    information, please refer to #654899.  Thanks to Wookey for the
    analysis and for identifying the source of the issue.

  * Do not assume that $pkg/usr/share/doc is present when jh_depends
    runs.  (Closes: #632620)
  * Applied changes from NMU.
    - depend on gcj-jdk rather than gcj for java-propose-classpath.
  * Added support for -s/--same-arch in jh_lib and related shell
    scripts.  (Closes: #632619)

  * Made jh_manifest always follow symlinks even if they are passed
    via command line.  (Closes: #626329)
  * Made jh_manifest fail if there are jar files it cannot find,
    unless the jar has been excluded.  This may cause packages to
    FTBFS instead of silently not shipping a jar file.
    (Closes: #626327)
  * Improved support for --no-act in jh_manifest.
  * Made jh_depends ignore links to jars as these most likely points
    to real jar files that it will end up processing any way.

  * Fixed a regression in 0.33 that in some cases would make
    jh_installlibs install in to the system root and not the package
    root.  (Closes: #624503)
  * Removed the -O option from jh_build since it clashed with a
    common debhelper option.  The longer form (--javadoc-opts) is
    still available and should be used instead.
  * Made all "jh_lib.sh"-based tools ignore the -O option, which is
    used by dh in some cases.  If you have been using -O with
    jh_build please switch to --javadoc-opts instead.

  * Fixed some bugs in jh_makepkg (Closes: #593351)
  * Support epochs in jh_installibs version mangling (Closes: #617897)

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Bumped Standards-Version 3.9.2 - no changes required.
    - Also bumped S-V in jh_makepkg.
  * Removed DMUA flag; no longer needed.
  * Removed -5/--sun5 option from jh_makepkg.
  * Used gcj-jdk instead of java-gcj-compat-dev in jh_makepkg.
  * Put the JDK dependency in Build-Depends of the control files
    generated by jh_makepkg, since it is needed by the clean rule.
  * Made cdbs run jh_installlibs before jh_manifest and jh_classpath.
    (Closes: #621857)
  * Converted tutorial into markdown format.
  * jh_installlibs now properly picks up the version of native packages.
    (Closes: #612404)
  * Made jh_installlibs respect its --tmpdir option. Previously it was
    silently ignored.
  * Added missing B-D-I on perl (for pod2man).
  * Migrated jh_generateorbitdir to the perl Manifest handler.
  * Fixed typo in jh_generateorbitdir and in jh_compilefeatures.
  * Fixed jh_classpath, which was horribly broken after the 0.32 upload.
    - It now adds debian/<pkg> automatically if it appears to be needed.
  * Made jh_manifest check the package dir if given a jar file, if said
    jar file does not exist.
  * Updated file suggestions for jh_classpath and added a note about
    the sequence change in the tutorial.
  * Updated jh_makepkg:
    - It now creates a separate doc package for the javadoc if making
      a library package.
    - It now adds ${java:Recommends} to all binary packages added.
  * Replaced old copyright template with a DEP-5 version.  Thanks to
    Martin Quinson for the suggestion and the template.

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Fixed quoting issue in jh_compilefeatures.
  * Renamed a function in the Eclipse module.
  * fetch-eclipse-source script to create tarballs from some eclipse
    upstreams. Its requirements have been added to javahelper's
    suggests.
  * Replaced jh_libs with jh_installlibs in the description of
    javahelper.
  * Bumped Standards-Versions to 3.9.0 - no changes required.
  * jh_depends now treats "headless" for the --jvm option differently.
    if "headless" is present then all JREs will be specified using
    their headless version. If headless is the only value, it will be
    read as "headless default".
  * jh_depends no longer recognises "sun5" as a valid JVM, since this
    has been removed from the archive. "sun" is now an alias of "sun6".
  * The --jvm "gcj" value for jh_depends now uses gcj-jre and not
    java-gcj-compat, since the latter is now a virtual package.
  * Made jh_depends produce (>= ${source:Version}) instead of
    (= ${binary:Version}). The latter would break with binNMUs.
  * jh_depends now generates a dependency list for javadocs based on
    which system javadocs they have been linked against. These packages
    are added to the new ${java:Recommends} variable.
  * jh_installeclipse now always emits ${orbit:Depends} even if it
    would be empty.
  * Fixed a formatting issue in the eclipse helpers.
  * Rewrote jh_manifest using debhelper as backend.
    - it now produces deterministic output (Closes: #574029)
    - removed all depends on python.
    - comments are now allowed in d/manifest files.
    - it will now produce a warning if a jar file listed in a d/manifest-
      file cannot be found (unless the jar was excluded).
  * Reordered the javahelper sequence so that jh_installlibs is now run
    before jh_classpath and jh_manifest.

  [ Matthew Johnson ]
  * If jars aren't specified by absolute path try finding them under
    /usr/share/java (Closes: #586783)
  * jh_build will now -link any javadoc in a package that you build-depend
    on
  * fix jh_build documentation

  * Fixed missing clean of the orbitdeps cache.
  * Made jh_generateorbitdir handle absolute paths correctly.
  * Updated jh_{generateorbitdir,installeclipse} manpages.
